        <p style="line-height: 150%">
            Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) affect a substantial and growing proportion 
            of the aging population worldwide. Despite the increasing number of clinical 
            trials aimed at exploring novel interventions for NDD, there is a substantial 
            heterogeneity in the selection of appropriate instruments for outcome measurement. 
            This study aimed to comprehensively investigate the outcome measurement instruments 
            employed in clinical trials of NDD in past two decades. We collected the entry 
            terms from Medical Subject Headings database and used as search keywords. An 
            automatic pipeline was designed to retrieve clinical trials, download registration 
            files, and extract meta information. The instruments employed in trials were 
            manually recognized and normalized by domain experts. A total of 4619 trials 
            posted from January 2001 to December 2022 were included for analysis, and 2494 
            unique instruments were identified. On average, 4.4 instruments were utilized 
            per trial, with a minimum of 1 and maximum of 31. Only 15 instruments were shared 
            across 6 common NDDs. 76.75% of the trials employed more than one instruments, 
            with many instruments being employed in combinations with others. The top 10 
            frequently employed instruments for each disease were determined, and their 
            temporal trends were continued to increase. we also explored the utilization 
            patterns of sub-modules and different versions of instruments. This study 
            provides a comprehensive investigation on implementation of instruments 
            utilized in clinical trials of NDDs, through the utilization patterns discovery 
            and temporal trends analysis. These findings have revealed employment heterogeneity 
            of outcome measurement instruments, and provided valuable insights for better 
            clinical practice of NDDs.

        <h1>Statistics</h1>
        <p>
            Initial search yielded 9,515 trials. Following the data filtering process, 
            instrument annotation, and eligibility assessment, a final data set of 4619 
            trials were retained for analysis. The submission date of these trials ranged 
            from January 2001 to December 2022. As shown in Table 1, the AD has the highest 
            number of trials with 2163 (46.83%),followed by PD (2013, 43.58%), ALS 177 
            (396, 8.57%), HD (132, 2.86%), LBD (90, 1.95%) and FTLD (69, 1.49%).
        </p>
        <p>
            A total of unique 10679 original instrument entities were annotated, which 
            were further mapped to 2494 normalized instruments. Table 1 shows the number 
            of clinical trials, employed instruments, unique instruments, and the average 
            number of instruments used in each trial. The overall average number of 
            instruments employed in trials is 4.4003, while the minimum number is 1 and 
            maximum number is 31. Alzheimer's disease has the highest number of unique 
            instruments of 1647 with an average of 4.5603 instruments used per trial. 
            FTLD has the highest average number of instruments per trial at 5.3188.
